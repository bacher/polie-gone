- [x] Use uint for joint attribute
- [x] Make dynamic scene
- [x] Add several game objects
- [x] Split shaders (regular and with skinning)
- [x] Support texturing
- [ ] Add texture based plains (height map)
- [ ] Add free-look camera (capture mouse)
- [ ] Add mouse-drag camera (drag to look)
- [ ] Spawn and destroy objects in time
- [ ] Add simple physics engine
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Use layout for shader attributes

Optimizations:

- [ ] Add out of view render optimization
- [ ] Add dynamic LOD optimization
- [ ] Use fewer joints to skinning
